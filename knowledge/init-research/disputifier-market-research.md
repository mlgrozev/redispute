## 📊 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Market Opportunity**: $2.6B market growing at 17.6% CAGR, with $43B in fraud losses by 2026

**The Opportunity**: Build a prevention-first platform with true AI, customer-facing tools to reduce friendly fraud, and transparent pricing for small-to-mid size businesses

- **Win Rate Industry Average**: 60-80% (reactive approach)

### Major Players

## 💡 DISRUPTION STRATEGY: "PreventFlow"

### Core Positioning

Target the underserved 84% of small-to-midsize e-commerce merchants with a prevention-first, customer-centric approach.

## 🚀 UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITIONS

### 1. **Customer-Facing Fraud Prevention Layer** 🎯
**THE BIG DIFFERENTIATOR**

Build a customer-facing app/widget that reduces friendly fraud before it happens:

**Features:**
- **Smart Dispute Resolution Portal**: When customers consider a chargeback, intercept with instant refund/exchange options
- **Transparent Order Tracking**: Real-time shipping updates reduce "item not received" chargebacks
- **Easy Returns Hub**: Make returns easier than chargebacks (solve the 84% problem)
- **Purchase History**: Help customers remember what they bought (impulse purchases forgotten = chargebacks)
- **One-Click Resolution**: Instant refund authorization for merchants under thresholds

**Impact**: Could prevent 40-60% of friendly fraud chargebacks before they're filed

### 2. **True Adaptive AI (Not Templates)**

**Real-time behavioral ML models that:**
- Learn from every merchant's unique transaction patterns
- Adapt to emerging fraud tactics automatically
- Generate custom evidence packages per dispute (not templates)
- Predict chargeback risk at checkout (not just post-purchase)

**Features:**
- Real-time risk scoring with explainable AI
- Continuous learning from outcomes
- Personalized fraud thresholds per merchant
- A/B testing fraud rules automatically

### 3. **Small Business First Pricing**

**Transparent tiered model:**

```
🆓 Free Tier (Under $50K/year)
- Up to 10 chargebacks/month
- Basic prevention tools
- Template responses

💼 Growth Tier ($50K-$500K/year) - $99/month
- Unlimited prevention
- AI-powered responses

```

**Why this works:**

- Lower success fees than Disputifier (12-15% vs 12-20%)

### 4. **Auto-Evidence Collection**

**Zero-touch evidence gathering:**
- Automatic screenshot capture of product pages at purchase time
- Communication history auto-archived
- Shipping proof automatically pulled from carriers
- Social proof (reviews, testimonials) auto-attached
- Customer interaction logs from all channels

**Merchant benefit**: 0 minutes spent per chargeback (vs 20-60 minutes currently)

### 5. **Friendly Fraud Education System**

**Teach customers what chargebacks really mean:**
- Email campaigns educating about chargeback consequences
- Pop-ups when customers request bank disputes
- "Did you try returning it?" interventions
- Rewards for using proper return process

### 6. **Advanced Prevention > Recovery**

**Shift focus from fighting to preventing:**

**Pre-transaction:**
- Device fingerprinting
- Behavioral biometrics
- Velocity checks
- Risk scoring at checkout

**Post-transaction:**
- Order confirmation optimization
- Proactive shipping updates
- Satisfaction check-ins
