## Section-by-Section Analysis

### 1. Hero Section (Above the Fold)

#### Check These Elements:

**Headline**:
- [ ] Is "Never Get a Payment Hold Again" the main H1?
- [ ] Is it large (48-60px on desktop)?
- [ ] Is it bold and immediately visible?
- [ ] Does it use high-contrast color?

**Subheadline**:
- [ ] Is the subheadline about "0.5% threshold" and "40-60% prevention" present?
- [ ] Is it 20-24px and clearly readable?
- [ ] Does it explain the outcome/benefit?

**CTAs**:
- [ ] Is there a prominent "Start Free Trial" button?
- [ ] Is it large, high-contrast, and clickable?
- [ ] Is there a secondary "Watch Demo" button?
- [ ] Are CTAs above the fold without scrolling?

**Visual**:
- [ ] Is there a dashboard mockup/screenshot?
- [ ] Does it show the dispute rate meter "0.38% 🟢 SAFE"?
- [ ] Are processor logos visible (Shopify, Stripe, PayPal, Klarna)?

**Overall Hero Assessment**:
- [ ] Can you understand what ReDispute does in 3 seconds?
- [ ] Is it immediately clear this is about preventing payment holds?
- [ ] Does it look modern and professional?

#### Common Issues to Fix:

❌ **If headline is too small**: "Make the hero headline 'Never Get a Payment Hold Again' much larger (56px) and bolder. It should be the most prominent text on the page."

❌ **If CTAs are weak**: "Make the 'Start Free Trial' button larger (at least 48px height), use bright green (#10B981), and add subtle shadow. Secondary 'Watch Demo' should be outlined/ghost style."

❌ **If no dashboard visual**: "Add a dashboard mockup image on the right side (desktop) showing the dispute rate meter at 0.38% with a green safety indicator."

---

### 2. Trust Signals Bar

#### Check These Elements:

- [ ] Is there a trust bar immediately after hero?

- [ ] Does it show "12,000+ Disputes Prevented"?
- [ ] Does it show "4.9/5 App Store Rating"?
- [ ] Are the numbers prominent and easy to scan?
- [ ] Are there icons next to each stat?

#### Common Issues to Fix:

❌ **If trust bar is missing**: "Add a trust signals bar immediately below the hero with these stats in large numbers: 500+ Stores, $240M+ Revenue Secured, 12K+ Disputes Prevented, 4.9/5 Rating. Use icons for each."

❌ **If numbers are too small**: "Make the trust signal numbers much larger (32px+) and bold. They should be attention-grabbing."

- [ ] Merchant quote: "I had $50,000 held..."
- [ ] Is the quote visually distinct (colored box/card)?

#### Common Issues to Fix:

- [ ] Alternating layout (text-left/image-right, then flip)

#### Common Issues to Fix:

❌ **If benefits lack visual hierarchy**: "For the 3 core benefits, add large numbered circles (1, 2, 3) in colored backgrounds. Use alternating layouts: first benefit with text on left and image on right, second with image on left and text on right."

❌ **If results aren't prominent**: "Highlight the 'Result:' text for each benefit in a colored box or badge. Examples: 'Reduce payment hold incidents by 80%', '$500-$5,000 saved monthly', '80%+ win rate'."

❌ **If no screenshots**: "Add dashboard screenshot mockups next to each benefit showing that specific feature in action."
